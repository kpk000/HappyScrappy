- Write for each of this variables the ones that you are gona use:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_BOT_ID= 

AMAZON_EMAIL=

## Usage
*HappyScrappy can be used in two ways*

#### Node js
- `node ./happyScrappy.js  --amazon --zalando --zooplus`
- Each argument is the scrapper that the main script `happyScript` is going to run. Delete the one that you don't need.
- The main script has a functionality in which if one thread is terminated, all are terminated, this facilitates the integration with PM2, as we will see below.
- This is not the correct way to run it, but it can be used for testing.

#### PM2 (recommended way)
*PM2 PM2 is an advanced process manager for NodeJS, it takes care of things like picking up scripts if they crash (that's why the tool is configured to kill all scripts if one crashes, so PM2 will instantiate them all), monitor them, run them when the system turns on...*
- `sudo npm install pm2@latest -g`

- Execute the tool from *command line*:
```node
pm2 start happyScript.js --  --amazon --zalando --zooplus
```
- Each argument is the scrapper that the main script `happyScript` is going to run. Delete the one that you don't need.

-  Execute the tool from the *PM2 config file* [ecosystem.config.cjs](ecosystem.config.cjs).
- More about it's configuration: https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/
- When you end the *config* configuration, execute it:
`pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs`

### Quick PM2 Guide
1. Start an Application
- To start a script:
```
pm2 start app.js
```

- To start and name your process (useful for later identification):
```
pm2 start app.js --name "my-app"
```

2. List Running Applications
- To list all processes managed by PM2:
```
pm2 list
```
3. Monitor Processes

- To monitor and see logs, CPU, and memory usage of all processes:
```
pm2 monit
```
4. Stop a Process
- To stop a process without removing it from PM2's list:
```
pm2 stop <app_name_or_id>
```
5. Restart a Process
- To restart a specific process:
```
pm2 restart <app_name_or_id>
```

6. Delete a Process
- To stop and remove a process from PM2â€™s management list:
```
pm2 delete <app_name_or_id>
```
7. Reload
- To reload a process gracefully (zero downtime if supported by your app):
```
pm2 reload <app_name_or_id>
```
8. View Logs
- To view combined logs of all processes:
```
pm2 logs
```
- To view logs for a specific process:
```
pm2 logs <app_name_or_id>
```
9. Startup Script
- To generate a startup script to resurrect PM2 and all processes on boot:
```
pm2 startup
```
